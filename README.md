# üõ°Ô∏è- Torrent Blocklist
This repository is made to provide a list of exclusions to apply in order to protect against malware in torrents.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive and may require some fine-tuning.

**All pull requests are welcome!**

## Which list should I choose ?
For general use, it is recommended to use the simple block list.
The ‚Äúextreme‚Äù list will block many items, which could cause problems with certain files.
Furthermore, if you are a seeder, seeding may not work because `*.nfo` files and other similar items are blocked.

Extreme list may be useful if you only download media files without seeding.

## How to apply the blocklist to qBittorent ?
- Go to the "Tool" menu
- Click "Options"
- Select the "Download" section
- Scroll down to "Excluded file names"
- Paste the list
- Click "Apply"

## Sources
The idea for this file came from reading this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1marge7/possible_malware_in_popular_torrent/).
Basically, I wanted to make my own list, but I thought it would be useful to make it public !
